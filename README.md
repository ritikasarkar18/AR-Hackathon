# AR-Hackathon

DISCLAIMER: Effect does not work in front camera, since it is a world effect.
Objective: We have tried to replicate natural landscapes using FaceBook's Spark AR Studio
Project Description:
1. Plane tracker- All subsequent 3D animated objects have been placed under this tracker. 
As soon as a plane is detected, we have to tap on the screen to place the the entire lawn consisting of the other objects there.
2. Animation- a) We have animated the leaves of the maple tree to fall from the tree on the lawn.
b) We have animated the sunflowers to rotate
3. Directional light- We have used this to replicate sunlight.

Pros: It is very realistic and we can zoom in very close to the objects and observe its features.

Cons: As we move the camera around, sometimes if we move too close to the maple tree, then the falling leaves get stuck to the camera.
Though it looks realistic, but as we zoom in or out it gets very difficult move the leaves away.
